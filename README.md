This is a simple game of tetris with an added twist.
You, the player, are able to choose a character with unique abilities to give this game a bit of added fun.
From shooting out rows or columns, to getting each piece you need to succeed and create combos, each character would be uniquely created to spice up an age old classic.

Characters:
------
||Blaster||shoots out rows and, anything that is above the blast, moves down||
------
||Chaser||creates multiple line blocks in succession to easily clear rows||
-----
||Combo master|| generates the most optimal piece and, for every cleared row during this ability's activation, extends the duration of this ability||

-----

things that need be done for the project:
character selection screen
character models
score tracking
connecting to a database
implementation of abilities
user profiles
